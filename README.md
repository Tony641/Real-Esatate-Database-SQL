### **Repository Description**

**Real-Estate-Database-SQL**  
A comprehensive and fully-featured SQL database schema designed for real estate management systems. This repository provides a robust foundation for managing properties, agents, clients, listings, sales, rentals, maintenance, and more. It is built using **Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL)** and includes all necessary tables, relationships, constraints, and sample queries.

---

### **Key Features**
1. **Complete Real Estate Workflow**:
   - Manage **properties**, **listings**, **sales**, and **rentals**.
   - Track **agents**, **clients**, and **transactions**.
   - Handle **appointments**, **inspections**, and **maintenance requests**.

2. **Modular and Scalable Design**:
   - Tables are organized into logical modules (e.g., `Property`, `Client`, `Agent`, `Transaction`).
   - Easily extendable to support additional features like **mortgages**, **offers**, and **auditing**.

3. **Data Integrity**:
   - Enforced relationships with **foreign keys**.
   - **Constraints** and **validation rules** for consistent data (e.g., `CHECK` constraints for valid property types, prices, and statuses).

4. **Advanced Functionality**:
   - Support for **property features** (e.g., swimming pools, garages) via a many-to-many relationship.
   - **Audit logging** to track changes to critical tables.
   - **User accounts** with role-based access control (e.g., Admin, Agent, Client).

5. **Sample Queries**:
   - Includes example queries for common operations like:
     - Finding active listings.
     - Tracking pending maintenance requests.
     - Generating sales reports.
